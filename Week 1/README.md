Week 1 – SOC Fundamentals, Monitoring & Incident Response

This week introduces the foundational concepts of Security Operations Centers (SOC), including their purpose, workflow, tools, and incident response processes.
Students will gain hands-on experience in log collection, analysis, alert configuration, and documentation within a mini-SOC lab environment.

Learning Objectives

Understand SOC structure, roles, and responsibilities

Learn key security monitoring and log management fundamentals

Explore core security tools such as SIEM, EDR, IDS/IPS, and vulnerability scanners

Apply basic security concepts including the CIA triad, threats, vulnerabilities, and risk

Follow standard SOC workflows and incident response lifecycles

Practice documenting security events, creating dashboards, and configuring alerts

Theoretical Knowledge
🧩 SOC Fundamentals and Operations

Learn:

Purpose: Proactive threat detection, incident response, continuous monitoring

Roles: Tier 1/2/3 analysts, SOC manager, threat hunters

Key Functions: Log analysis, alert triage, threat intelligence integration

References: NIST frameworks, MITRE ATT&CK, IBM & Microsoft SOC walkthrough videos

🔍 Security Monitoring Basics

Learn:

Objectives: Detect anomalies, unauthorized access, and policy violations

Tools: SIEM (Splunk, Elastic), network traffic analyzers (Wireshark)

Key Metrics: False positives/negatives, Mean Time to Detect (MTTD)

References: Elastic SIEM guides, Boss of the SOC datasets

🧾 Log Management Fundamentals

Learn:

Log Lifecycle: Collection, normalization, storage, retention, analysis

Common Log Types: Windows Event Logs, Syslog, HTTP server logs

Tools: Fluentd, Logstash

References: KQL in Elastic SIEM, JSON/CEF log formats

🛠️ Security Tools Overview

References: Splunk Free, Wazuh, Osquery, Nessus Essentials

🧠 Basic Security Concepts

Learn:

CIA Triad: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability

Threat vs Vulnerability vs Risk

Defense-in-Depth, Zero Trust

⚙️ Security Operations Workflow

Learn:

Detection: Alerts from SIEM/EDR

Triage: Prioritize based on severity

Investigation: Correlate logs, hunt IOCs

Response: Containment, eradication

References: TheHive platform simulations

🚨 Incident Response Basics

Learn:

IR Lifecycle: Preparation → Identification → Containment → Eradication → Recovery → Lessons Learned

🗒️ Documentation Standards

Learn:

Incident reports, runbooks, SOPs, post-mortems

References: SANS Incident Handler’s Handbook

Practical Application
1️⃣ Log Analysis Practice

Windows Event Viewer:

Filter for Event ID 4625 (failed login) or 7045 (new service creation).

Identify brute-force attacks from Security logs.

Browser History Analysis:

Use Eric Zimmerman’s Tools to parse Chrome history for malicious URLs.

Advanced Task:

Brute-Force Detection: Generate failed logins in your Windows VM (wrong password attempts).

Use Event Viewer to filter Event ID 4625 and export results to CSV.

Zimmerman Tools Practice: Download LECmd and parse Chrome history from your VM.

Look for visits to a test URL (e.g., http://test.com).

Tools:

Built-in: Windows Event Viewer, wevtutil CLI

Third-party: LogParser Lizard, Elastic SIEM

2️⃣ Document Security Events

How to Perform:

Create a template with fields:

Date/Time	Source IP	Event ID	Description	Action Taken
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM	192.168.x.x	4625	Multiple failed logins detected	User account locked

Practice documenting a mock event (e.g., “Multiple failed logins from 192.168.1.10”).

3️⃣ Set Up Monitoring Dashboards

Steps:

In Kibana or Grafana, create visualizations for:

Top 10 source IPs generating alerts

Frequency of critical Event IDs

Use pre-built dashboards (e.g., Sigma detection rules).

4️⃣ Configure Alert Rules

In Elastic SIEM:

Rule: “Detect 5+ failed logins in 5 minutes”

Index: security-login-*

Condition: count > 5

Test: Simulate failed SSH logins

Advanced Task:

Custom Alert Rule:
Create a rule in Wazuh to detect 3+ failed logins in 2 minutes.
Test by attempting failed SSH logins (ssh user@192.168.1.x with wrong password).

Alert Validation:
Verify alerts in the Wazuh dashboard and document the rule’s effectiveness.

Learning Approach

Tools: Build a mini-SOC lab with Wazuh (SIEM) + Osquery (endpoint visibility)

Process: Use MITRE ATT&CK to map alerts to adversary tactics (e.g., T1059 for PowerShell attacks)

Outcome: Integrate practical exercises with theoretical knowledge for end-to-end SOC understanding
